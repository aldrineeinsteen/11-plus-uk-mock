### Section C: Reasoning

31. 32 (each number is doubled from the previous one)
32. 4 cm (the sides of the rectangles are in a ratio of 2:3, so if the length of the second rectangle is three times larger, the width will also be three times larger)
33. 20 (each number increases by 2 more than the previous increase)
34. x = 5 (to solve the equation for x, add 3 to both sides to get 4x = 20, then divide both sides by 4)
35. 2 days (if the number of men doubles, the time taken halves assuming they work at the same rate)


### Section D: Geometry

36. The area is 153.86 cm² (use the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr²)
37. The volume is 125 cm³ (use the formula for the volume of a cube, V = s³)
38. The area is 60 cm² (use the formula for the area of a triangle, A = 1/2bh)
39. The volume is 267.95 cm³ (use the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = 4/3πr³)
40. The circumference is 47.1 cm (use the formula for the circumference of a circle, C = πd)

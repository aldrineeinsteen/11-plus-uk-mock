### Section C: Reasoning

11. B. 48 (each number is doubled from the previous one)
12. A. 6 cm (the sides of the rectangles are in a ratio of 3:4, so if the length of the second rectangle is three times larger, the width will also be three times larger)
13. B. 21 (each number increases by 2 more than the previous increase)
14. B. x = 6 (to solve the equation for x, add 2 to both sides to get 3x = 18, then divide both sides by 3)

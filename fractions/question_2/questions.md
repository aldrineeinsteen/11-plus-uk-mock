**YEAR 5 FRACTION ARITHMETICS - PAPER 2**

**Instructions:**

Complete each problem by performing the correct fraction arithmetic. Simplify your answers as much as possible. Show all your work.

**Examples:**

1. **Addition**: 3/7 + 2/5

   To add fractions, make the denominators the same. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 5 is 35. So, convert each fraction to have that denominator:

   3/7 = 15/35, 2/5 = 14/35

   Now, add the fractions:

   15/35 + 14/35 = 29/35

2. **Subtraction**: 4/5 - 3/7

   Find the LCM of 5 and 7, which is 35:

   4/5 = 28/35, 3/7 = 15/35

   Subtract the fractions:

   28/35 - 15/35 = 13/35

3. **Multiplication**: 3/5 x 2/3

   Multiply the numerators and the denominators:

   (3 x 2)/(5 x 3) = 6/15 = 2/5 (after simplifying)

4. **Division**: 5/6 ÷ 3/4

   Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second:

   5/6 x 4/3 = 20/18 = 10/9 or 1 1/9 (after simplifying)
